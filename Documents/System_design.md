========
## Introduction
In recent years, with the development of the Internet, the application of network technology has been deepened, web page production and website construction
have become more and more popular, and various web pages and website construction software have emerged one after another.
A webpage is a window for displaying news on the Internet.
Whether the webpage is made and designed exquisitely, whether it is rich in content, and whether it is easy to operate is the main factor that attracts users.
Web page design and production is one of the basic skills that need to be mastered when reading news online.



__Project name__

The project name is : **NewsPaper App**



## Overview
The team is using html to develop a web page where users can log in and register.A high level summary that every engineer at the company should understand and use to decide if it's useful for them to read the rest of the doc. It should be 3 paragraphs max.we will create a useful system design and help our teammate understand how this program usually work ,and we will make this document as helpful as we can.


## Goal
one of the most important goal is to get use to work in a project by being a part of time in software industry, through some controlling tools like git, GitHub, and gitLab, also to get to use the task manager websites like Trello.com,and spread the tasks for each member of the team. But our main goal is to learn new technologies and show our ability to change at a moment's notice, giving us the important skills we need to work in this volatile world where technology is constantly changing and getting better,and make the life of user and admin easier.We want to make sure this application is not all about the manipulation but also the user experience. If a user enjoys our design and is able to use the website with ease that can be considered a success.We as a team need to work together to make sure that our application can not only show off our skills in data manipulation and be an easy and enjoyable user experience, but also show how we can work as a team and these are the goals for our application.


## Context
Everyone at this time has the required knowledge to make this project work, we would like to see all pages implemented in the first month and having all the functionality in the second month.any remaining time can be spent on making the website look better. main causes for concern would be to get the full working application out as soon as possible to comply with deadlines and get our grades. the appearance of the website can be changed as the team feels.


## Design
Page planning: Front presentation: home page, about page,search, register, login. home page would contain some description,about page would describe something in detail,register page will help user register in the website,login page will help user login into this page,and we will use a random database to finish this program.


## Architectural plan
The application's design is created via HTML and CSS. The HTML contains wrapper classes and classes have boxes where user can type username and password into it and there are also some buttons which can share this website to other friends. then we have some taps which show user different topics of other information As it is a static webpage ,you can do fresh which can fresh the whole webpage.


## Testing plan
during test strategy,we need to test every function one by one,including system testing the tester should have the ability to understand customers point of view,then we should test the whole program,the goal is to test the whole program to see what will happen, if anything unexpected occurs ,then we need to fix them .


## Maintenance plan
Since the interface was designed to be as dynamic as possible, the only part of the web that could require maintenance is the data API itself. 
This information can easily be changed by adjusting a single variable in the code,our teammate will do the mainly maintenance and fix bug


 #### Design:
The project is a sample web application that allows the users to register in the page. 
There shall be CSS Reference and CSS Properties that will make the page easier to use and understandable.
This project will make junior developers increasing his/her knowledge and make them work as a time and also allow them to contribute a lot to the projects development.
By using classes and id we can divide the work into neat bundles of code which offer a lot of functionality while still being very readable. 
The work should use simple functionality that will make code neater throughout the entire project so the project will be a very simple one.


#### Functionality:
First page will have a well designed registration system page.
After which the user will be redirected to their supposed forms, I.e the admin will be directed to the users management form and the user will be taken to the booking flight form where they can fill up the information required.


## Testing plan
Test strategy is that,we should test every function one by one ,including system testing the tester should have the ability to understand user point of view,
then we should test the whole program, the goal is that what basic thing user want from our App, is firstly information about flight 
,so we test flight details first and then we upload it and also , 
and we test database so that user can easily sign up and then can sign in without any trouble, 
for testing the booking system we give wrong information if it gives us ticket so we need to fix it .


## TDD
Test strategy is that,we should test every function one by one ,
including system testing the tester should have the ability to understand user point of view,then we should test the whole program,
the goal is that what basic thing user want from our App, is firstly information about flight ,

#### current situation
As the world gets more and more efficient technology needs to move along with it, 
and so we have the idea to create an application that will make it very easy for the user to register for now,
we have decided how the project should look like and we have got a team of 3 people who will be working on it.
