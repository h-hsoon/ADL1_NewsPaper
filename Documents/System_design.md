__Project name__

The project name is : **NewsPaper App**



## Overview
The team is using html to develop a web page where users can log in and register.A high level summary that every engineer at the company should understand and use to decide if it's useful for them to read the rest of the doc. It should be 3 paragraphs max.we will create a useful system design and help our teammate understand how this program usually work ,and we will make this document as helpful as we can.


## Goal
one of the most important goal is to get use to work in a project by being a part of time in software industry, through some controlling tools like git, GitHub, and gitLab, also to get to use the task manager websites like Trello.com,and spread the tasks for each member of the team. But our main goal is to learn new technologies and show our ability to change at a moment's notice, giving us the important skills we need to work in this volatile world where technology is constantly changing and getting better,and make the life of user and admin easier.We want to make sure this application is not all about the manipulation but also the user experience. If a user enjoys our design and is able to use the website with ease that can be considered a success.We as a team need to work together to make sure that our application can not only show off our skills in data manipulation and be an easy and enjoyable user experience, but also show how we can work as a team and these are the goals for our application.


## Context
Everyone at this time has the required knowledge to make this project work, we would like to see all pages implemented in the first month and having all the functionality in the second month.any remaining time can be spent on making the website look better. main causes for concern would be to get the full working application out as soon as possible to comply with deadlines and get our grades. the appearance of the website can be changed as the team feels.


## Design
Page planning: Front presentation: home page, about page,search, register, login. home page would contain some description,about page would describe something in detail,register page will help user register in the website,login page will help user login into this page,and we will use a random database to finish this program.


## Architectural plan
The application's design is created via HTML and CSS. The HTML contains wrapper classes and classes have boxes where user can type username and password into it and there are also some buttons which can share this website to other friends. then we have some taps which show user different topics of other information As it is a static webpage ,you can do fresh which can fresh the whole webpage.


## Testing plan
during test strategy,we need to test every function one by one,including system testing the tester should have the ability to understand customers point of view,then we should test the whole program,the goal is to test the whole program to see what will happen, if anything unexpected occurs ,then we need to fix them .


## Maintenance plan
Since the interface was designed to be as dynamic as possible, the only part of the web that could require maintenance is the data API itself. 
This information can easily be changed by adjusting a single variable in the code,our teammate will do the mainly maintenance and fix bug
