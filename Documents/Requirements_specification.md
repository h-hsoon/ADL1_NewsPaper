## Project name
The project name is : NewsPaper.

## Purpose

The purpose of the project is to make a website that will let the user create an account.
We chose Visual Studio Code"VSCode" as a text editor or an IDE to use and make our project because it's simple and straight forward to work on. 
Our web application can let the user create his/her own account and have access to the index page where the main content will be setted up on.

## Intended audience
Intended to be used by anyone who is interested in reading news from a e-paper which comes from multiple sources around the world.

The types of news are from different fields for example Sport news ,politic news ,economic news ,science news...

Starting from the user logging on the application to browsing the news then choosing the one they want to read and they will be redirect to source of the news. 
   

## User Needs
To use this web page, user needs to find the web page in any browser by using the name of the page, then the user can see the front of the web page which has a sign up and log in place so in order to register the user need to fill out his/her username which is email and enter password than log in. When a user logs in he/she can see the main page of the web application.

## System rules, patterns, recommendations

For this project we will use HTML and CSS and PHP for the front in , basically for create a web page , for every problem ,we meet ,we will try to find good solution for it ,we will try to use good technology, such as visual studio code ,and some other compiler would also be fine for us. css and html will be the main languages we use.

## Project outline

This project will make junior developers increasing his/her knowledge and make them work as a team and allow them to contribute a lot to the projects' development.

by using classes and id we can divide the work into neat bundles of code which offer a lot of functionality while still being very readable. The work should use simple functionality that will make code neater throughout the entire project so the project will be a very simple one.

## Goal

One of the most important goal is to get used to work in a project by being a part of time in software industry, through some controlling tools like git, GitHub, and gitLab, also to get to use the task manager websites like Trello.com, and spread the tasks for each member of the team.
But our main goal is to learn new technologies and show our ability to change at a moment's notice, giving us the important skills we need to work in this volatile world where technology is constantly changing and getting better,and make the life of user and admin easier.
We want to make sure this application is not all about the manipulation (??) but also the user experience. If a user enjoys our design and is able to use the website with ease that can be considered a success.
We as a team need to work together to make sure that our application can not only show off our skills in data manipulation and be an easy and enjoyable user experience, but also show how we can work as a team and these are the goals for our application.
